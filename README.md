# Electron screen recorder  
I got the inspiration from Jeff Delaney @ fireship.io. I created my own version due to the lack of support of newer Electron versions (and of course i wanted to learn more about js and cross-platform frameworks). This version will work with Electron(-forge) v9 and newer.
